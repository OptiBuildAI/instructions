## How to view the website

Go to [optibuildai.github.io/instructions](https://optibuildai.github.io/instructions).

## How to edit the website

What you see right now on github is basically a folder (like the folders on your
computer in file explorer/finder).

You can browse to the `src` folder and inside it are a bunch of .md files (also known as
"Markdown"). These are plain text files that make make up the contents of your website.

You can click on one of those files and edit its contents by clicking on the "pencil"
icon at the top right of the screen. Once you are done with your changes click the
green "commit" button, and go with the default options (specifically, be sure it is
merging to main).

Once its saved, give it a minute and your website will automatically update!

SUMMARY.md is your table of contents, which just contains links to the various
.md files for each page.

You can learn more about how this all works by reading the [mdBook][mdbook] documentation.
Specifically, you probably care most about the [anatomy of a book][anatomy] section.
